<h1>The Best Movies According to Bruno</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
 <p>One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, I recommend watching it</p>

 <h3>Halloween</h3>
 <p>It’s a terrifying and creepy film about what one of the characters calls Evil Personified. Right. And that leads us to the one small piece of plot I’m going to describe. There’s this six-year-old kid who commits a murder right at the beginning of the movie, and is sent away, and is described by his psychiatrist as someone he spent eight years trying to help, and then the next seven years trying to keep locked up. But the guy escapes. And he returns on Halloween to the same town and the same street where he committed his first murder. And while the local babysitters telephone their boyfriends and watch “The Thing” on television, he goes back into action.</p>

 <h3>The Hangover</h3>
 <p>In THE HANGOVER, Doug (Justin Bartha) and three friends (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis) drive to Las Vegas for a wild and memorable stag party. In fact, when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning, they can’t remember a thing; nor can they find Doug. With little time to spare, the three hazy pals try to retrace their steps and find Doug so they can get him back to Los Angeles in time to walk down the aisle.</p>
