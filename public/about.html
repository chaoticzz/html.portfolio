<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Bruno and I’m an enthusiast interested in venturing into web development by first and foremost getting a background in HTML and CSS. I have a huge interest in technology and I’m looking forward to specializing in front-end development.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning the structure and behavior of web pages, writing small projects, and best code organization and design in school, and I’m all ears for any new information and simply starving to learn more.</p>
<p>I 'm a responsible, motivated, and proactive individual who’s open to feedback and dedicated to personal and professional development. Currently looking for entry-level openings/Internships/Collaborative projects to apply my skills, gain hands-on experience and contribute within a team setting.</p>
<p>If you’re open to connection, sharing of insights or have opportunities for Junior developers , I would really appreciate the chance to learn from you.</p>
